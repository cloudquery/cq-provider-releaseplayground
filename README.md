CloudQuery ReleasePlayground Provider ![BuildStatus](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/cloudquery/cq-provider-releaseplayground/test?style=flat-square) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cloudquery/cloudquery?style=flat-square)
==================================

This [CloudQuery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) provider is only for testing purposes.

## What is CloudQuery

CloudQuery pulls, normalize, expose and monitor your cloud infrastructure and SaaS apps as a SQL database.
This abstracts various scattered APIs enabling you to define security,governance,cost and compliance policies with SQL

cloudquery can be easily extended to more resources and SaaS providers (open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/issues)).

cloudquery comes with built-in policy packs such as: [AWS CIS](#running-policy-packs) (more is coming!).

Think about cloudquery as a compliance-as-code tool inspired by tools like [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)
and [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), cool right?
